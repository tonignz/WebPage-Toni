				<h2>Experience</h2>
				<p>Welcome to my professional journey, where I've had the privilege of applying my skills and expertise in various roles within the field of electronic engineering and automation. Take a closer look at my experiences, ranging from software development and quality assurance to project leadership and technical innovation.</p>

				<h3>Electronic Laboratory and SQA Lead</h3>
				<h4>April 2023 - Now</h4>
				<p>In my most recent role, I assumed leadership of a team of engineers as the technical lead. While many
					of my tasks remained consistent with previous roles, such as application development, test
					automation, and equipment testing, I also took on the responsibility of guiding the team and
					fostering their growth as software validation and SQA professionals. This involved managing the
					team's activities, including scheduling, resource allocation, and task assignment, as well as
					advocating for improved tools and resources. It was during this stage that I successfully introduced
					industry-standard tools like CANoe from Vector, enhancing our capabilities and efficiency.</p>

				<p>Additionally, I led efforts to standardize and formalize internal SQA testing procedures, addressing
					the need for clearer specifications and protocols. This initiative involved extensive work in
					typifying and standardizing tests, ensuring consistency and quality across projects. Furthermore, I
					expanded my role by delivering international training sessions for subsidiary teams, some of which
					were conducted remotely, while others required direct travel, such as trips to China.</p>

				<p>Throughout these endeavors, I have consistently led the team's projects and validation processes,
					ensuring smooth operations and effective delivery. I have also demonstrated adept conflict
					management skills, resolving tasks with proximity and assertiveness when necessary. Moreover, I have
					implemented agile methodologies like Kanban in Jira to manage the team's tasks efficiently and
					effectively.</p>

				<h3>Software Quality Assurance (SQA)</h3>
				<h4>February 2021 - March 2023</h4>
				<p>Throughout my as an SQA, I gained extensive knowledge of communication protocols such as CAN and LIN.
					Specifically, I became proficient in the J1939 protocol, a specialized automotive standard that
					defines the upper layers of the OSI model. Additionally, I worked extensively with the CANopen
					protocol, particularly under the CiA 301 and CiA 402 standards. In the realm of LIN, I focused on
					proprietary LIN implementations and standards defined by clients. My responsibilities included
					defining functional and communication tests for both complete systems and specific components.</p>

				<p>I utilized tools such as BUSMASTER, KVASER, and EMOTAS for testing, as well as error management and
					collaboration tools like Jira and Subversion repositories. Furthermore, I continued to deepen my
					knowledge of programming languages such as Python and LabVIEW. In addition to my core
					responsibilities, I conducted extensive data analysis to decode communication bus behaviors and
					identify errors, anomalies, or trends in the tested devices. These data analysis techniques not only
					facilitated error detection but also served as a basis for laboratory improvements, enabling more
					precise and comprehensive data collection from various test benches.</p>

				<p>I also actively contributed to the development of numerous applications in LabVIEW. These
					applications were not limited to testing purposes but were also leveraged across departments,
					subsidiaries, and even by end clients. By creating user-friendly and efficient LabVIEW applications,
					I facilitated smoother operations and enhanced productivity throughout the organization.</p>

				<p>Moreover, I had the opportunity to work directly with clients, honing my skills in customer
					orientation and negotiation. This involved collaborating with international clients, sometimes
					traveling to their facilities to provide on-site support and address their needs. These interactions
					not only enhanced my technical expertise but also allowed me to develop strong interpersonal skills
					and a deep understanding of client requirements in the automotive industry.</p>

				<h3>Electronic Laboratory Engineer</h3>
				<h4>February 2020 - January 2021</h4>
				<p>During my tenure, I was entrusted with a range of responsibilities primarily focused on test
					automation and monitoring. This pivotal role afforded me the opportunity to deepen my understanding
					and proficiency in key technologies such as Python and LabVIEW for software automation, while also
					gaining expertise in hardware development platforms like Arduino and Microchip for test equipment
					integration.</p>

				<p>Leveraging these tools, I spearheaded the automation of various electrical and electronic tests,
					including immunity, electrical, and mechanical trials, within the automotive industry.</p>

				<p>This experience not only honed my technical skills but also provided valuable insights into the
					industrial landscape of automotive engineering. In addition to test automation, I played a crucial
					role in the meticulous monitoring and management of ongoing tests, ensuring adherence to established
					protocols and standards. This required a keen attention to detail and a proactive approach to
					problem-solving, as I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to address any issues and
					optimize test procedures.</p>

				<h3>Engineering Intern in Laboratory</h3>
				<h4>February 2019 - January 2020</h4>
				<p>I embarked on this stage during my final year of undergraduate studies. This invaluable experience
					provided me with a practical understanding of conducting small-scale experiments and meticulously
					documenting their procedures and outcomes. Throughout this period, I actively engaged in various
					tasks, including data collection, analysis, and report writing, under the guidance of seasoned
					professionals in the field. This immersive learning environment not only enhanced my technical
					skills but also instilled in me a strong sense of professionalism and attention to detail.</p>
