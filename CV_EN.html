					<h4>(April 2023 - Now)</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					<p>In my most recent role, I assumed leadership of a team of engineers as the technical lead. While many
						of my tasks remained consistent with previous roles, such as application development, test
						automation, and equipment testing, I also took on the responsibility of guiding the team and
						fostering their growth as software validation and SQA professionals. This involved managing the
						team's activities, including scheduling, resource allocation, and task assignment, as well as
						advocating for improved tools and resources. It was during this stage that I successfully introduced
						industry-standard tools like CANoe from Vector, enhancing our capabilities and efficiency.</p>
	
					<p>Additionally, I led efforts to standardize and formalize internal SQA testing procedures, addressing
						the need for clearer specifications and protocols. This initiative involved extensive work in
						typifying and standardizing tests, ensuring consistency and quality across projects. Furthermore, I
						expanded my role by delivering international training sessions for subsidiary teams, some of which
						were conducted remotely, while others required direct travel, such as trips to China.</p>
	
					<p>Throughout these endeavors, I have consistently led the team's projects and validation processes,
						ensuring smooth operations and effective delivery. I have also demonstrated adept conflict
						management skills, resolving tasks with proximity and assertiveness when necessary. Moreover, I have
						implemented agile methodologies like Kanban in Jira to manage the team's tasks efficiently and
						effectively.</p>

					<h4>February 2021 - March 2023</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					<p>Throughout my as an SQA, I gained extensive knowledge of communication protocols such as CAN and LIN.
						Specifically, I became proficient in the J1939 protocol, a specialized automotive standard that
						defines the upper layers of the OSI model. Additionally, I worked extensively with the CANopen
						protocol, particularly under the CiA 301 and CiA 402 standards. In the realm of LIN, I focused on
						proprietary LIN implementations and standards defined by clients. My responsibilities included
						defining functional and communication tests for both complete systems and specific components.</p>

					<p>I utilized tools such as BUSMASTER, KVASER, and EMOTAS for testing, as well as error management and
						collaboration tools like Jira and Subversion repositories. Furthermore, I continued to deepen my
						knowledge of programming languages such as Python and LabVIEW. In addition to my core
						responsibilities, I conducted extensive data analysis to decode communication bus behaviors and
						identify errors, anomalies, or trends in the tested devices. These data analysis techniques not only
						facilitated error detection but also served as a basis for laboratory improvements, enabling more
						precise and comprehensive data collection from various test benches.</p>

					<p>I also actively contributed to the development of numerous applications in LabVIEW. These
						applications were not limited to testing purposes but were also leveraged across departments,
						subsidiaries, and even by end clients. By creating user-friendly and efficient LabVIEW applications,
						I facilitated smoother operations and enhanced productivity throughout the organization.</p>

					<p>Moreover, I had the opportunity to work directly with clients, honing my skills in customer
						orientation and negotiation. This involved collaborating with international clients, sometimes
						traveling to their facilities to provide on-site support and address their needs. These interactions
						not only enhanced my technical expertise but also allowed me to develop strong interpersonal skills
						and a deep understanding of client requirements in the automotive industry.</p>
