# Web Development Project

This project consists of creating a personal website using HTML and CSS to showcase information about Toni Gonzalez (me) and my projects.

## Project Contents

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: This file contains the HTML structure of the website, including the header, navigation, main content, and footer.
- `styles.css`: This file contains the CSS styles applied to the website to enhance its appearance and design.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- In the `index.html` file, you'll find the HTML structure of the website, including the header, navigation, main content, and footer.
- In the `styles.css` file, you'll find the CSS styles applied to the website to customize its appearance.

## Using the Project

To view the website in action, simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. Make sure both the `index.html` file and the `styles.css` file are in the same folder so that the styles are applied correctly.

## Contributions
